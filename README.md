# RevisionTools
Free desktop app with different productivity tools to aid revision. This project was initially made in frustration as many once-great revision tools such as Quizlet are now charging people even to use their basic functionality, and there is yet to be a program which contains many different revision tools all in one place. The program is a work in progress, and more tools will be added.
**Disclaimer: This program was originally intended to be used only by me, and I may not have time to implement any suggestions.**

## Tools included

### Memorise Text
This program was created to help people memorise long pieces of text, such as speeches, by repetitively asking the user to fill in the blanks of the text. When you first revise a "set", the program will randomly hide 10% of the words, and ask you to fill it in. If you get 80% or more correct, the program increases the amount of words it hides to 20%, and so on. If you get less than 80% correct, the program will decrease the amount of words it hides.
