# RevisionTools
Free desktop app with different productivity tools to aid revision. This project was initially made in frustration as many once-great revision tools such as Quizlet are now charging people even to use their basic functionality, and there is yet to be a program which contains many different revision tools all in one place. The program is a work in progress, and more tools will be added.
**Disclaimer: This program was originally intended to be used only by me, and I may not have time to implement any suggestions.**

## What are sets?
Sets are a core feature of RevisionTools. A set is a program-specific term which just means a file that contains the material to be revised, in text form. There are two types of sets: a normal set (just called "set") and a paired set (called "pset").

A normal set is a set with content. This type of set can be used by tools such as "Memorise Text".

A paired set is a set which contains pairs of terms, typically a "Question" and an "Answer", like the front and back of a flashcard. This type of set can be used by tools such as "Flashcards". A paired set also gives you the ability to flag specific pairs of terms for future revision, and thus allows you to only revise flagged terms, etc.

The two sets are unfortunately not interchangeable (i.e: "Memorise Tools" cannot be used with Paired Sets, and "Flashcards" cannot be used with a normal set), but one set can be used across many tools (if the tool supports it) (such as a Paired Set being used for both "Flashcards" and "Match Up")

## Tools included
The program is a work in progress. More tools will be added.

### Memorise Text
This program was created to help people memorise long pieces of text, such as speeches, by repetitively asking the user to fill in the blanks of the text. When you first revise a "set", the program will randomly hide 10% of the words, and ask you to fill it in. If you get 80% or more correct, the program increases the amount of words it hides to 20%, and so on. If you get less than 80% correct, the program will decrease the amount of words it hides.
